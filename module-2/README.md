# Lab Outline

**Total estimated time: 1 hr 30 mins**

## Tools and Repo

+  Clond Repo with workshop files
+  Install following tools in Cloud Shell
    
    +  `Helm` for application management
    +  `kubectx/kubens` for easy context switching

## Kubernetes Multicluster Architecture (35 mins)

+  Deploy three Kubernetes Engine clusters (10 mins)

    +  Use gcloud
    +  Two clusters (`cluster-1` and `cluster-2`) used for multi-cluster and application deployment
    +  One cluster (`cluster-3`) used for Spinnaker, NGINX LB and Container Registry

+  Install Istio on all three clusters (5 mins)

    +  Use latest release artifacts (0.8 and onwards will have LTS)
    +  Use Helm
    +  Enable sidecar injector for `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` for the `default` namespace
    +  For using _Ingress_ and _RouteRules_ later in the lab

+  Install and configure Spinnaker on `cluster-3` (20 mins)

    +  Create service accounts and GCS buckets
    +  Create secret with kubeconfig
    +  Create spinnaker config
    +  Use helm charts by Vic (***chart deployment takes about 10 mins***)

## Application lifecycle management with Spinnaker (35 mins)

+  Prepare Container Registry
    +  Push a simple `web-server` app to Container Registry with version tag `v1.0.0`
    +  Push `busyboxplus` to COntainer registry to simulate canary testing
    
+  Configure a **Deploy** pipeline in Spinnaker to deploy a web app to both clusters

    +  Deploy Canary > Test Canary > Manual Judgement > Deploy to Prod (5 mins)
    +  Triggered via version tag (`v.*`) from Container Registry

+  Manually deploy pipeline for `v1.0.0` to `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` (10 mins)

## Load Balancing traffic to cluster-1 and cluster-2 (20 mins)

+  Load balance traffic using an NGINX load balancer to both `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` (10 mins)

    +  Install NGINX LB in `cluster-3` (outside of `cluster-1` and `cluster-2`)
    +  Configure a ConfigMap for `load-balancer.conf` with `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` Ingress IP addresses pointing to the webapp
    +  Expose NGINX as `Type:LoadBalancer` for Client access
    +  Manipulate `weight` fields in the ConfigMap to manage traffic between `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` 

## Triggering application updates with Spinnaker (35 mins)

+  Trigger the **Deploy** pipeline by updating the version tag to `v1.0.1` in Container Registry (15 mins)

## Traffic management to prod and canary using Istio

+  Use _RouteRules_ to route traffic between _prod_ and _canary_ releases within each cluster (10 mins)
